## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I'm Shivani Gautam ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a passionate developer with a love for creating innovative solutions. I specialize in working with machine learning models for image processing and interpretability. I am pursuing a doctoral degreen in CS, probably will finish my research by next year specializing in machine learning. I have background in Information Technology with some research works in WSN and Cryptography. 

## Skills
- **Languages**: Python, Java
- **Frameworks**: React
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, Docker

## Projects
- Text Mining in Heterogeneous Database systems : A master's project based on NLP, NLTK, SpaCy Libraries incorporating real life Housing Lease Dataset. It involves scanning documents, reading like a normal OCR will do, sperate tokens, lemmetization, analysis incorporating MongoDB and Power BI with interactive dashboard for customers. Advant: users don't have to rely on reading the huge number of pages of leases, they can just check the three dashboard and make changes in the lease as per requirement. 
- Book Recommendation System: An undergrad project built on Hadoop for big data analysis of different recommendation based architectures and comparative analysis. Advant: understood which algorithms would be beneficial to use for what kind of database through survey and implementation analysis on library book dataset.
