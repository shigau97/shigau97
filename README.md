## Hi there, I'm Shivani Gautam 👋
I'm a passionate developer with a love for creating innovative solutions. I specialize in working with machine learning models for image processing and interpretability. I am pursuing a doctoral degree in CS, and will probably finish my research by next year 2026, specializing in machine learning. I have a background in Information Technology with some research work in WSN and Cryptography. 

## Skills
- **Languages**: Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS
- **Frameworks**: React
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, Docker

## 🔬 Research Highlights
- **MSFormer**: Multi-modal malware classifier achieving 95.17% accuracy on 2.6M+ samples using transformer architectures. Published at IEEE CARS 2025
- GPU optimization research at CCAST - Assisting with pbs-slurm translations of legacy codes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python | PyTorch | TensorFlow | Transformers | SLURM/HPC | scikit-learn | pandas | NumPy

## Projects
- MSFormer based multiclass classification of cybersecurity dataset highlighting usage of CBSequence based word2vec embeddings, clustering, fusion, SMOTE, interpretable. 
- Text Mining in Heterogeneous Database systems: A master's project based on NLP, NLTK, SpaCy Libraries, incorporating real life Housing Lease Dataset. It involves scanning documents, reading like a normal OCR will do, separating tokens, lemmatization, analysis, incorporating MongoDB and Power BI with an interactive dashboard for customers. Advant: users don't have to rely on reading the huge number of pages of leases, they can just check the three dashboards and make changes in the lease as per requirement. 
- Book Recommendation System: An undergrad project built on Hadoop for big data analysis of different recommendation-based architectures and comparative analysis. Advant: understood which algorithms would be beneficial to use for what kind of database through survey and implementation analysis on the library book dataset.
